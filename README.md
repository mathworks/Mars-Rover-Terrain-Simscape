# **Mars Rover Model in Simscape&trade;**
Copyright 2021-2022 The MathWorks, Inc.

This example models a mars rover that navigates a path on uneven terrain 
to retrieve a sample.  
* **Contact forces** are modeled between the six driven wheels and the terrain. 
* **Path following and speed control algorithms** adjust the wheel steer angles 
  and speeds to guide the rover to the sample.
* **Inverse kinematic analysis** is used to plan the rover arm joint angle
  trajectories that will enable the arm to acquire and store the sample.
* **Electric motors** can be used to estimate rover power consumption.
